This repository contains basic C++ code for understanding the basic concepts in C++, also develop a Particle Explosion UI project using SDL library (By using SDL library, I understood how to include standard or third party Libraries in your existing code).

The repository is just for the purpose exploring and revising/re-learning of C++ concepts.
